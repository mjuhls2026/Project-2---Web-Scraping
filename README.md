# Project-2---Web-Scraping

#### The purpose of my project was to perform an analysis on scraped data from a NASCAR Cup series stats website.
I changed my website a couple of times from the initial one I submitted because I kept getting a 403 error until I found one that didn't have that issue. I saw you posted about the headers on Slack after I had begun working with the new website, but at that point, it didn't make sense to me to switch back and lose progress. Along with the site change, I also had to change my questions to fit the data from the new site better. Those questions are in the attached ipynb file with the rest of the project.
